## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Query

### What I learned

I am most proud of this trick :
```css
button {
  color: inherit;
}
```
instead of class on each button to set the color to the article color It was easier to just type this one time
and inherit the color from the .article class


### Continued development

I would like to work on the responsive part and find a way to make it responsive without the need of @media
